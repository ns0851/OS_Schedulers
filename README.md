C program implementing various scheduler algorithms mainly FCFS, SJF, RR and MLFQ. 
The current version is a bit wonky with FCFS being just in order execution and MLFQ needs to be updated to make it work.
The file shows various ways of implementing schedulers in C language(going from most naive to C idiomatic approaches that align a bit more to how real OS works)
