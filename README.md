C program implementing various scheduler algorithms... mainly FCFS, SJF, RR, and MLFQ. The current version consists of a working MLFQ algorithm though FCFS is simple in-order execution and needs to be worked on. The file shows different ways of implementing schedulers in C, from naive to more idiomatic approaches that align a bit more with how real OS schedulers work :)
